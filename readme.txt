This plugin allows you to change any BuddyPress group into a fan page group, where only admins and moderators can post. 

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to change any BuddyPress group into a fan page, where only admins and moderators can post new forum topics and activity items. Members can read all the content but they cannot add anything. The Forum has been renamed to 'Announcements' and non admin users will not be able to create new topics but they will be able to reply. Similarly non admin cannot add new activity updates but they can reply to them.

The plugin also adds a 'Fan Pages' link in the Groups directory page to view all the fan pages used on the site.

== Installation ==
activate plugin and go - to settings to change.
